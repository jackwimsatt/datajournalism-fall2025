Assignment 5
I would call the style of the lede in this article a narrative lede. Instead of jumping straight into numbers or analysis, they open with a real event that tells the story of how the town became so quickly engulfed by the fire, making it more personal. I think this lede is relatively effective because it immediately grabs your attention. I particularly like the last piece of the lede where it mentions how fires being unpredictable being a somewhat myth because I had always thought conversely. It also clearly shows what the rest of the story will focus on: the idea that there are many other places in the West that face the same kinds of risks as Paradise. 
I thought the data involved in the story was extremely strong. They very clearly explained how they analyzed the data to make sense of preventing worse case scenarios in the future. I was able to track their grading criteria of their scale, all of the other measures were very concise and easy to understand. The findings showed that there were over 500 towns that were at a higher risk than Paradise due to higher proportions of disabled and/or elderly citizens, quantity of escape routes, and quantity and proximity of mobile homes to one another. 
I thought the human voices involved in the story definitely strengthened the article. Most of the sources in the article were taken straight from field professionals such as reporters and fire officials who seemed to have a pretty close relationship with the affected region. The other material I found to be understandable and strengthened the story as well; specifically the sources pertaining to other potentially threatened communities across the country. 
The story primarily used an inverted pyramid structure. I know this because it lead with the main data and then trickled down into explanations and details. I think this is also called a martini glass structure because the most broad statements are at the top of the story, and the most detailed are closer towards the end. 
I did find the story to be a little bit dense with numbers, all of which were clearly laid out, but the ratio of how many metrics were included per paragraph was a little high for my liking, particularly when explaining how hazard scores were calculated. I would have fixed this via using fewer variables back to back and a little more focus back to the driving point as to why those numbers affected residents’ safety. 
The interactive maps and charts let readers easily check the wildfire risk in their own communities, visually compare different locations without wading through dense tables of numbers, and recognize broader geographic patterns of wildfire danger across the West. The visuals feel like they serve their purpose rather than decorative because they directly advance the story’s goal of showing where wildfire risk exists and how extensive it is.
The authors are clear and transparent about how the data was collected and where the story could go further. They explain that the hazard scores represent potential risk rather than guaranteed outcomes, and that no model can fully account for unpredictable factors like fire behavior or emergency response.
