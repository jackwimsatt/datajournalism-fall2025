DC Crime Data
Which neihborhood cluster experienced the most violent crime?
I used a pivot table putting the offense group in the filters, neighborhood cluster in rows and offense in the values section. 
I found that cluster 14 was the neighborhood that experienced the most violent crime.

How many black men experienced a drug overdose deaths as a result of a synethetic opioid, not including methadone?
I used a pivot table placing stub_label in filters, panel in rows, and count of unit in values.
I found 21 black men passed as a result of a drug overdose from a synethic opioid excluding methadone. 


Already Been Done 
Existing coverage and public data focus heavily on the overall scale of the crisis in Maryland and its capital city, Baltimore, while also highlighting recent statewide success.
Focus on Baltimore/Maryland Fatalities: Several reports detail the severe impact of the epidemic in Baltimore and the state of Maryland, often highlighting specific demographics and local tragedy.
NYT - Baltimore opioid epidemic, OD deaths
Highlighting a Positive Trend: Recent coverage has focused on a significant and positive data pointâ€”a reported large decline in deaths.
Maryland Matters - Maryland overdose deaths fell 30% in 2024
Public Data Availability: State and local health agencies provide interactive dashboards and public data on both fatal and non-fatal incidents, demonstrating transparency and a commitment to data-sharing.
MD Health - Dashboards: Nonfatal Overdoses
Baltimore City Overdose Dashboard
Anne Arundel Health - Opioid-Related Data
DC Data Snapshot: Separate data exists for Washington, D.C., confirming the ongoing crisis in the district, though the depth of coverage appears less comparative than that for Maryland.

What Hasn't Been Done
The most obvious gap in coverage lies in the lack of detailed, equitable analysis of Maryland's reported 30% reduction in overdose deaths. While the headline number is positive, we don't know who benefited from this decline and if the success is masking persistent disparities.
 Tracking the Equity of Maryland's 30% Drop in Overdose Fatalities.
This investigation will:
Disaggregate the 30% decline: Use the available datasets to break down the drop in fatalities by race/ethnicity, specific neighborhood/zip code, and age group.
Connect Intervention to Outcome: Compare the demographic data from the MD Opioid Command Center's grants (where money was spent) to the actual distribution of the decline (where lives were saved).
Comparative Analysis: Use DC and national data as a benchmark to assess if Maryland's success is a genuine policy victory or simply a reflection of broader national trends, and identify which specific MD interventions (e.g., naloxone distribution, medication-assisted treatment access) proved most effective for high-risk populations.

High-Quality Datasets for the Story
To execute this angle, the story requires granular, source-level data. Here are three high-quality datasets to anchor the reporting:
Dataset
Trustworthiness
Limitations
1. CDC Drug Overdose Death Rates by Demographics
Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via Data.gov.
Trustworthiness: Data is compiled, standardized, and vetted by the principal federal public health agency. Its goal is to provide reliable national, state, and county-level surveillance data.
2. Maryland Department of Health (MDH) Nonfatal Overdose Data
Source: Maryland Department of Health dashboards, focusing on nonfatal incidents link.
Trustworthiness: Official state-level data collection, mandated for public health tracking. This data is often near real-time and highly localized, reflecting recent crisis activity and EMS response patterns.
3. MD Opioid Operational Command Center (OOCC) Grants Reference
Source: Maryland OOCC Grants Reference Demographic Information PDF link.
Trustworthiness: Direct information from the state body tasked with coordinating and funding opioid intervention programs. This data shows where, and for which populations, funding was allocated.
